I am a senior student and will pursue postgraduate studies in China University of Geosciences, Wuhan. 

I am studying under Professor Chang Tang and my current research interests include:
1. multi-modal learning and its application.
2. graph neural network and its application.
3. diffusion model and its application.

If you are interested in the research direction I am interested in and want to communicate with me or have any questions you would like to consult me, please contact me!

B.S. in Intelligent Science and Technology

"I" on Many Skills
======
1. I can independently based on pytorch framework to build models and training and testing.
   
2. I also have some data analysis ability and frequently use numpy, pandas, scipy, matplotlib and other toolkits to participate in many mathematical modeling and data analysis competitions and have won good awards.

3. I can use QT(GUI) to make software with a visual interface and successfully apply for software copyright.

4. I know a little bit about C++, because my frequent use of C++ ended at the end of my sophomore semester.

5. I have a little knowledge of JAVA, because I often use JAVA, until success submit JAVA course design of the course.

6. I can implement simple optimization algorithms such as particle swarm, simulated annealing, etc., because I took a course on intelligent optimization algorithms in my junior year.
   
7. I am teaching myself MySQL, because I hope it will be helpful for my future research.
